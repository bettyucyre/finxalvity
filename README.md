# How to Get Unbanned on Final Fantasy XIV (2025 Guide) 🌟

Getting banned from Final Fantasy XIV can feel like being locked out of Eorzea’s grandest adventures, especially if you think it’s a big mistake. This friendly guide will help you figure out what to do if you’ve been banned and how to appeal your ban with the best chance of returning to your warrior of light or mischievous mage.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your ban hit you harder than a Drachen Armor spam and follow you across multiple accounts? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! This means Final Fantasy XIV has flagged your computer’s hardware, making it tricky to log back into the servers even if you try a fresh account.

Using an HWID spoofer can be your secret potion to get back into the game if you’re caught in a hardware ban.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check your emails or any messages from Square Enix to find out the official reason. Common ban reasons include:  
- Cheating, botting, or using unauthorized third-party software  
- Toxic behavior, trolling, or harassment of fellow adventurers  
- Account sharing or suspected suspicious activity  

**Tip:** Always review the Square Enix Terms of Service before you send an appeal—knowledge is your sharpest sword here.
